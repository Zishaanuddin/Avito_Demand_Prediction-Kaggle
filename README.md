# Avito_Demand_Prediction-Kaggle
In eCommerce, combinations of tiny, nuanced details of the product can lead to building a massive difference in increasing the interest of a user to purchase.
Following details mentioned below can make a big difference in developing interest if a user got a glance of the product.
So, the above few examples state how one seller can optimize the listing of the product in the eCommerce website.

But what happens even if a seller has a fully optimized listing of his product and not getting any number of sales.
That leads to a problem in analyzing the demand of the product the seller wants to sell. This is so important because if a seller invests 
money in advertising and people don't visit his product or even after visiting, they are not interested in buying the product, it clearly explains 
some sort of problem in seller’s product.

Companies such as Amazon or flipkart spends millions in advertising and if the demand of the products does not exist lead to a terrific loss to the company 
or even a seller who overspends his own money in advertising his product, if his product demands does not exist simply frustrating the seller can lead to a 
big business problem.

In April 2018 Avito, opened up a competition in kaggle which was based on the predictions of demands that any goods has or not. Avito is a Russian classified 
advertisements website with sections devoted to general goods for sale, jobs, real estate, personals, cars for sale, and services. Avito is the most popular 
classifieds site in Russia and is the second biggest classifieds site in the world after Craigslist. [Source: Wikipedia].

The dataset has been created by the Avito’s team in which the dataset has various categorical features such as advertisement id, advertisement title, 
advertisement description, advertisement image, item_id, user_id, etc with deal_probablity as the target variable. Here the deal probability is the 
continuous variable which ranges from 0 to 1. Zeros indicate the least probabilities of the item to be purchased and 1 indicates the highest 
probabilities of the item to be purchased. So this problem is the Regression problem in machine learning.
